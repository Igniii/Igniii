## Hey there 🤙

I'm Igniii, a full-stack developer based in Spain.

I enjoy building purposeful systems — taking an idea and turning it into a clean, functional product. I focus on solid architectures, predictable behavior, and long-term maintainability across both the frontend and backend.

**Tech stack:** Angular ⚡ TypeScript ⚡ Spring Boot ⚡ MySQL ⚡ Railway 

### 💻 What I'm working on
I'm expanding my tech stack and refining how I approach full-stack development.

My current main project is a full-stack **inventory management system**, originally built for my final degree project and now the project that shaped how I think about software design.

Every project I build is intentional and meant to teach me something new.
