## Hey there 🤙

I'm **Igniii**, a full-stack developer based in Spain building purposeful systems that last.

I turn ideas into clean, functional products — the kind that work predictably and don't fall apart six months later. My focus is on solid architectures, maintainable code, and systems that solve real problems across the entire stack.
