## Hey there 🤙

I'm Igniii, a full-stack developer based in Spain.

I like building things with purpose. Turning an idea into a functioning system is what keeps me coding — connecting each layer until everything works as one cohesive piece. When something captures my attention, I tend to dive deep until it becomes a finished, structured project.

My core stack is **Angular**, **TypeScript**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**. I focus on clean architectures, predictable behavior, and long-term maintainability. Working across the entire stack gives me the control I need to shape how a system grows from start to finish.

### What I'm working on right now 💻
I'm expanding my tech stack and refining how I approach full-stack development.

My main project is a full-stack **inventory management system** — originally built for my final degree project, and now the project that defined how I understand software design.

I don’t have hundreds of repositories, but every project I create is deliberate, structured, and built to teach me something new.

If you want to discuss code, architecture, or how to make systems more reliable, you can reach me here on GitHub.
